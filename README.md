# Bio-Clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) Model

This repository contains code for developing and evaluating a **bio-clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER)** model. The project uses a fine-tuned version of the **BERT-based transformer model**, pre-trained on a general corpus and adapted for bio-clinical text using a **synthetic dataset**. The NER model is optimized for recognizing and classifying medical entities in biomedical and clinical datasets.

## Project Overview

The project involves:

1. **Model Architecture**: 
   - The model is based on **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, a transformer-based deep learning model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus. We fine-tune this model specifically for bio-clinical NER tasks.

2. **Synthetic Dataset**: 
   - The model is trained on a synthetic bio-clinical dataset that mimics real-world clinical scenarios, including entity types such as diseases, symptoms, and treatments.

3. **Dataset Preprocessing**: 
   - Mapping bio-clinical dataset labels into numeric values for model compatibility.
   - Applying data filtration to clean the dataset and ensure high-quality training data.

4. **Fine-Tuning**: 
   - Fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT model on bio-clinical NER tasks allows the model to specialize in recognizing medical entities. This significantly enhances its accuracy on biomedical data.

5. **Evaluation**: 
   - The model is evaluated using a bio-clinical test set, measuring its effectiveness in recognizing clinical entities.

6. **Metric Computation**: 
   - Performance is measured using accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall to assess the NER model's clinical entity recognition capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Required Libraries:
  - `transformers`
  - `datasets`
  - `numpy`
  - `wandb`

## Installation

To install the required packages, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Make sure you have wandb set up for experiment logging.

Usage
Preprocessing the Dataset
The dataset is mapped into numeric labels before training. Here's how to initialize the preprocessing:

python
Copy code
datasets = datasets.map(lambda example: {
    "tokens": example['tokens'],
    "tags": example["tags"],
    "numeric_tags": [label.encode_example(x) for x in example["tags"]]
})
Tokenization and Label Alignment
In this model, tokenization is essential for handling biomedical terminology. We use the tokenize_and_align_labels function to ensure that tokenized words (including subwords) are aligned with their corresponding labels:

python
Copy code
def tokenize_and_align_labels(examples):
    tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(examples["tokens"], truncation=True, is_split_into_words=True, max_length=512)

    labels = []
    for i, label in enumerate(examples["numeric_tags"]):
        word_ids = tokenized_inputs.word_ids(batch_index=i)
        previous_word_idx = None
        label_ids = []
        for word_idx in word_ids:
            if word_idx is None:
                label_ids.append(-100)  # Special tokens ignored in loss function
            elif word_idx != previous_word_idx:
                label_ids.append(label[word_idx])  # Assign label to the first token of each word
            else:
                label_ids.append(-100)
            previous_word_idx = word_idx

        labels.append(label_ids)

    tokenized_inputs["labels"] = labels
    return tokenized_inputs
Training the Model
To start the training, initialize wandb and fine-tune the BERT model:

python
Copy code
import wandb
wandb.init(name="bio_clinical_ner")
trainer.train()
Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model using the following command:

python
Copy code
trainer.evaluate()
Making Predictions
Once trained, you can generate predictions using:

python
Copy code
predictions, labels, _ = trainer.predict(tokenized_datasets["test"])
predictions = np.argmax(predictions, axis=2)
Compute Performance Metrics
Finally, compute the performance metrics such as accuracy and F1 score:

python
Copy code
results = metric.compute(predictions=true_predictions, references=true_labels)
print(results)
Results
The model’s performance is tracked via wandb and evaluated using common NER metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are particularly important for assessing the model's ability to accurately classify medical entities, which is critical for clinical applications.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how the BERT-based transformer model can be fine-tuned for bio-clinical NER tasks using synthetic datasets. The combination of fine-tuning, tokenization, and data filtration techniques ensures robust performance in recognizing medical entities, making the model suitable for applications like medical documentation analysis and clinical text processing.
